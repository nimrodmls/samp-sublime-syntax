# SAMP Chatlog Syntax Highlighting (for Sublime Text 3)
### What is this?
The SAMP Chatlog Syntax Highlighting, similar to any Syntax Highlighting for Programming Languages, is simply highlighting text in the SAMP Chatlog according to patterns, based on the SAMP Server's method of presenting the text.

### Currently Supported Servers
* Red County Roleplay (Monokai Theme **ONLY**)

### How to Install
1. Download Sublime Text 3
2. Download the contents of this repository (whether by cloning or downloading the master)
3. Copy both SAMP.sublime-synax & Monokai.sublime-color-scheme to %appdata%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User
4. Open the Chatlog in Sublime Text 3 - It should automatically detect this file as a SAMP Chatlog
